I introduced my self.
Learned about the basic Hardware components of the computer such as cpu, Memory, Storage medium (HDD, SSD) and how fast they can read and write the data. 
And also the cache Memory.
We discussed about the whats app working method. Like Developer -> Build & Deployment -> Server <-> Data Base.
Types of data transfer methods,
    1.UDP
    2.TCP
    3.HTTPS
UDP have very fast data transfer they don't store any log data. But TCP method stores the log and it helps to rectify the error later period.
And how DNS works and website ip. Each website have unique IP and that ip is mapped to the domain name called google.com have unique ip.
